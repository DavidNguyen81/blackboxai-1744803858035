## Project Overview
The Spa Management System is a simple web application designed to manage spa operations with a focus on user authentication. It features a login page that allows users to enter their credentials and access the spa management dashboard.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```

   This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Open the application**:
   Open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
